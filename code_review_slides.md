# jpass-smartcard
* works with the Java Card simulator  
* database really processed through the card - nice!
* authors have not done testing on a real card
    * compilation errors
    * reported to the team, we fixed it together
    * applet has not worked on a card, reason unknown

---

# FindBugs
* static code analysis
* total: 54 issues
    * 28 in the original version
    * Applet: 9
    * jpass.smartcard: 16
    * jpass.ui: 1
* dead stores, unused methods...
* Unread field Applet.SecureChannel.keyMAC
    * $\implies$ no message integrity?

# Symmetric Key Derivation
* shared secret established using Diffie-Hellman key exchange
* result truncated to 256 bits and directly used as an AES key
* result of DH should be first hashed and after that used as a symmetric key

---

# PIN Verification
* redundant check for remaining tries
* method OwnerPIN.check does that for you
```java
if(ins == INS_VERIFYPIN) {
  if((short)m_pin.getTriesRemaining() > (short)0) {
        VerifyPIN(apdu);
  } else {
        ISOException.throwIt(SW_BAD_PIN);
  }
}
```

---

# PIN Verification II
* redundant call for PIN check
```java
// in method VerifyPIN
if (m_pin.check(apdubuf,
            ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA,
            (byte) dataLen) == false) {
        ISOException.throwIt(SW_BAD_PIN);
} else {
        m_pin.reset();
        m_pin.check(apdubuf,
            ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA,
            (byte) dataLen);
}
```

---

# PIN Verification III
* method ```OwnerPIN.reset```{.java} only called right between successful PIN verifications (previous slide)
* `reset` is not called in methods `select` or `deselect`
* after successful PIN verification card stays in an authenticated state
* after authentication, another application can select the applet and do commands without PIN authentication

# Padding oracle
* padding functionality potentionally vulnerable to padding oracle attack

```java
// in method CBC_BULK_Finish
short outLen = m_bulk_cbc_cipher.doFinal(... // 16
short unpad = padding.unpad(... // [-1..15]
if(unpad >= 0) {
        outLen = unpad;
}
Util.arrayCopyNonAtomic(...
this.wrapAndSend(apdu, outLen); // 16b => invalid pad
```
